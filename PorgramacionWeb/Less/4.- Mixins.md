the mixins are like the functions of the other languages.

we can declare them in a file and import in the main file in differents declarations.

to create a mixin we start them with .

```ad-info
icon: less
title: declare mixin
~~~less
.fuente(@font-size){
    font-size: @font-size;
    line-height: @font-size + 10%;
}

#we can use parameters with the mixin or declare a void mixin
~~~

```

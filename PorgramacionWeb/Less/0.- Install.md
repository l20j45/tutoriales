we can use less in diferents forms.

1. We can use [prepos](https://prepros.io)
	Prepos is a sofware to compile LESS/SASS/PUG files.
	work on linux, Windows and Mac.
	have an a free version but seems to anyone for me

2. If we use Visual studio code.
	We can use the Hero Add-on to compile the files
	in this way the compiler is integrate with the work for and seems to more easy then the first way.

3. If we love work on terminal.
	We ca install LESS compiler.
	LESS compiler works with Node.js and to install we need to run this in our terminal.
	```ad-info
	icon: npm
	title: Install Less
	~~~bash
	npm install -g less lessc styles.less styles.css
	~~~
	```

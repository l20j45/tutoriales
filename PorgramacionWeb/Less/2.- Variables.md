We can use variables in less, we only need to declare them in the file that we use.

```ad-info
icon: less
title: variable declare
~~~less
@color-primary:#333333;
# the variables ever start with @
after the name we need to write his definition.
~~~
```


```ad-info
icon: less
title: use variables
~~~less
    font-family: @Fuente1;
#we write the identifier and in his definition we put the variable.
~~~
```

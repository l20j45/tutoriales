we can create a css files for different use such as sections.

we write the code like a normal css file and later we can nest another definition like:

```ad-info
icon: less
title: Nesting
~~~less
.intro{ #create a class definition
    margin: 0 auto;
    .sombra-caja;
    &__imagen{ #i use BEM as metodology and this nest with the previous class
        width: 1320px;
        position: absolute;
        img {
            width: 100%;
            height: 624px;
            object-fit: cover;
        }
    }
}

~~~

```

```ad-info
icon: less
title: import
if we need or it was our choose we can import another files to build the css File
~~~less

@import "filename";

~~~

```
